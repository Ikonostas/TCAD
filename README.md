Inspect
Sentaurus Workbench.
 
 Tasks solved with Sentaurus TCAD
Modeling the technology of creating a device;
Structure and topology modeling;
Simulation of electrical, thermal and optical characteristics of the formed structures, their operation at low and high levels of signals, transients, etc.;
Modeling of thermal modes of operation of structures and mechanical stresses in structures;
Optimization of technology, design and topology according to specified criteria.

Instrument simulation input parameters:
Instrument structure, dopant distribution profiles;
Boundary conditions, for example, voltages on the electrodes;
Finite element mesh.

Device simulation output parameters:
Charge carrier concentration;
Electric fields;
